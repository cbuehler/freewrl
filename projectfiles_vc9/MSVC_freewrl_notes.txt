ACTIVEX CONTROL/PLUGIN NOTES:
The freewrlAx project is for the ActiveX control, which is the InternetExplorer plugin for freewrl. 
You need something more than the free express edition of Visual C++ to build it (there are dlls etc it needs for ActiveX controls).
The project initiator had Visual C++ 2003 Standard Edition kicking around, so that's what it's currently checked in with. 
And freewrlAx depends on libfreewrl built slightly differently than for the console program (but you can build it with MSVC express).
To build the libfreewrl for the ActiveX control you need to change the following compiler settings:
In libfreeWRL > Property Pages > Configuration Properties > C/C++ > Preprocessor > Preprocessor Definitions
change the following:
COMPILING_ACTIVEX_FRONTEND_no
FRONTEND_HANDLES_DISPLAY_THREAD_no
FRONTEND_GETS_FILES_no
to:
COMPILING_ACTIVEX_FRONTEND
FRONTEND_HANDLES_DISPLAY_THREAD
FRONTEND_GETS_FILES
Then when building for everything else, change those back.
Otherwise the regular freewrl will just exit without showing anything.

GENERAL WIN32 TO DO:
To do/not done yet: 
-  libeai / EAI / SAI   
-  sound not attempted
-  fullscreen not properly implemented
-  Internet Explorer plugin (ActiveX control) is in-process but not complete  
-  in theory the main program should have the popup window, and call into the library (right now
   the popup window code is in the library)

ABOUT THE LIBRARIES IN LIB_WINDOWS:
MSVC compatible libraries - you got them from the link on the windowsbuild page (or as of sept 16, 2010 http://dug9.users.sourceforge.net/lib_windows.zip)
Then if you cvs check out freewrl\freex3d cvs to your directory 'source' then put the lib_windows and fonts directories in 'source' too:
ie 
c:\source\freewrl ... source code as CVS checked out
c:\source\fonts
c:\source\lib_windows

But where did I get them?
gdiplus.lib/.dll - .lib seems to be on my system somewhere
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6a63ab9c-df12-4d41-933c-be590feaa05a&DisplayLang=en  GDI+ redistributable download - gdiplus.dll 2MB 

MSopenGL - my windows system directories, for a msvc 6.0A directory (not sure what it was installed with. Just opengl 2.1)
zlib - yafaray^ see below
pthreads - http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/
openexr_static - yafaray
libxml2 - yafaray
freetype2 - http://freetype.sourceforge.net/index2.html  (has a build directory for VS2008)
expat - likely: http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/ which has a 2007 download which is the datestamp on my files
glew - http://glew.sourceforge.net/  
JS (javascript) - I got from an older freewrl source .tar and tinkered
^  www.yafaray.org - has vs2008 .sln files
