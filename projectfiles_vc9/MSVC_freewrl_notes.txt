 
Getting Started:
1. download the free MS Visual C++ 2008 Express edition if you don't already have it
http://www.microsoft.com/Express/vc/ 
2. navigate your web browser to the download page from freewrl.sourceforge.net http://freewrl.sourceforge.net/download.html and download the Source Code tar and unzip
3. download the msvc compatible libraries from
http://cid-4a0d5f15141a58d5.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/GPUGroupX3D/freewrlWin32
3.a lib_msvcCompat.zip
3.b fonts.zip
unzip and put them in freewrl/freex3d/lib and freewrl/freex3d/fonts
4. You should be able to build the Debug version of lib and standalone projects, except when you go to run it will complain about missing dlls.
Go into the lib/windows/ directories and copy the dlls from the dlls_copy_to_debug directory and put in the projectfiles_vc9/Debug directory
5. Download and install Wget and Unzip from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html into C:/Program Files/GnuWin32

Current state of the MSVC freewrl project as of Aug 23, 2009
- standalone (src/lib src/bin projectfiles_vc9) can be cvs checked out (main branch: freewrl/freex3d - see download page) and builds and runs not bad (hard to know without seeing other versions)
- uses glew and wgl for opengl
- you need also the msvc-compatible libraries (include,lib,dll) and JS currently available on Dougs skydrive - see link from download page
- in the code WIN32 define is for both cygwin and msvc ports, _MSC_VER is for MSVC and is automatically defined by the compiler

To do/not done yet: 
-  libeai - test cvs code for win32/msvc changes, update WIN32 to _MSC_VER where appropriate  
-  plugin, sound not attempted yet
-  snapshot, consoleMessage stubbed out
-  fwWindow32.c is a mess of dead code, fullscreen not properly implemented


MSVC compatible libraries - likely just recompiled gnu libs - where I got them:
jpeg - OpenCV (book CD) try:  http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/ and/or http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22870 pre1.1 win
MSopenGL - my windows system directories, for a msvc 6.0A directory (not sure what it was installed with. Just opengl 2.1)
zlib - yafaray^ see below
pthreads - http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/
png - yafaray
openexr_static - yafaray
libxml2 - yafaray
freetype2 - http://freetype.sourceforge.net/index2.html  (has a build directory for VS2008)
expat - likely: http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/ which has a 2007 download which is the datestamp on my files
glew - http://glew.sourceforge.net/  
JS (javascript) - I got from an older freewrl source .tar and tinkered
^  www.yafaray.org - has vs2008 .sln files (their server is slow right now)
