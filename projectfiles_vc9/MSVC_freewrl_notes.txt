MSVC compatible libraries - you got them from the link on the windowsbuild page (or as of sept 16, 2010 http://dug9.users.sourceforge.net/lib_windows.zip)
Then if you cvs check out freewrl\freex3d cvs to your directory 'source' then put the lib_windows and fonts directories in 'source' too:
ie 
c:\source\freewrl ... source code as CVS checked out
c:\source\fonts
c:\source\lib_windows

But where did I get them?
gdiplus.lib/.dll - .lib seems to be on my system somewhere
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6a63ab9c-df12-4d41-933c-be590feaa05a&DisplayLang=en  GDI+ redistributable download - gdiplus.dll 2MB
