Priority list (as of 25/02/2009)

25/02/2009: OSX and possibly Linux:
	freewrl http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Basic/GeoSpatial/HelloEarth.x3d
	on command line prepends current path; eg: 
	problem reading file '/Users/john/http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/exa...

24/02/2009: on OSX, the following tests have problems:

	19 - pink robot? *(FIXED- do_shininess call JAS)
	20 - not sorted?
	25,26 - Textures on backgrounds.
	47.wrl (beachball) fwLoad, unknown -111 (FIXED - JAS)
	49.wrl - no output?
	50 - FreeWRL: SoundEngine not installed on system
	9.wrl - shapes disappear.
	SFImage.wrl - box not changing texture
	pp2.x3d - nothing shown.
	stringSensor.x3dv - hangs?


06/02/09: Examine orientations incorrect.
	take tests/1.wrl, add:
	Viewpoint {description "1" position 0 0 10}
	Viewpoint {description "2" orientation 0 1 0 3.14 position 0 0 -10}
	Viewpoint {description "3" orientation 0 1 0 1.57 position 10 0 0}
	Viewpoint {description "4" orientation 0 -1 0 1.57 position -10 0 0}
	and note that vps 3 and 4 rotate incorrectly; and that farPlane calculated incorrectly for 2.

06/02/09: New build on some Linux distros fails. Decide what to do about this - currently thinking
	about supporting both makefile.pl and autotools, until the autotools one can be built once other Linuxes 
        catch up with Debian.

	Note - autotools version requires automake-1.10 right now (stable as of jan.2008)

-------
- design & implement a modern log,warning & error reporting (all)
  -> configurable at compilation time (enable/disable parts of debug information)
  -> configurable at runtime (...)

- review all Geospatial nodes (JohnS)
- implement FloatingOrigin in Geospatial code (Johns)
- Points and Lines - send upstream bounds, as per faceset nodes (JohnS)
- Review all uses of gluUnproject in code (Johns)
- OSX - standalone front end - enable printing;
- OSX - standalone front end - ensure pulldown menu items tied with actual rendering variables
- OSX - stanaalone front end - "q" key does not store window parameters in OSX; can "q" be mapped to
  call normal cocoa exit routine?
- OSX - standalone front end - sometimes, especially with textured world, front/back buffers are not
  updated; it is as if one of them gets forgotten about (verify which one with opengl profiler). Complex
  worlds with lots of textures seem to trigger it.


- EAI - Sarah (C bindings) and JohnS (Russ Kinters testing, and general Java code)
- threading issues with XLib - harold and Michel.
- merge into freewrl
- OSX standalone front end updateContext()
- View Frustum - see PalaceWalkthrough and Geospatial code. (in progress -JohnS)
- XML parser - Script and Proto work, and general cleanup
- DVD standalone - get Geospatial content on there, and running.
- FillProperties - use brickshader style shader to implement them.
- Shader variables not parsed nor sent to shaders.
- OSX sound revisit.
- GlassBunny.wrl - CubeMap textures (Michel) and Shader variables (Johns).
- resolve QA issues in the code - implicit function declarations, etc. (Ian,Michel?)
- debug browser plugin

Wishlist:

- QTVR images from OSX 
- deliver x11freewrl on OSX, in addition to cocoa version
- create freewrl links on Linux and OSX
- update the plugin to provide EAI/SAI access via browser's javascript

Priority list (as of 20/11/2008):

- EAI - Sarah and Russ Kinter
- merge into freewrl
- Apple - Gurob email
- OSX standalone front end updateContext()
- XML parser - Script and Proto work, and general cleanup
- FillProperties
- Shader variables
- Component verification
