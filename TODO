Priority list
08/05/2009:
	(JAS) children fields are sorted, but we use a the node children field. This can give us grief for when we
	use EAI/SAI to get/set individual children elements. Shadow the sorting, and also move sorting to the end of
	the scene graph to better get the scenegraph static during the rendering phase. Currently, the following nodes
	have sorted children: GeoLocation, GeoTransform, Group, Transform, HAnim nodes, Billboard, Collision,
	Anchor and Inline. Is this enough, or too much? 

01/05/2009:
	(JAS) OSX Sound node - in middle of updating code. Complete, and migrate to XCode.
	(JAS) it is possible to loose objects at farClipPlane when "backing up" 
	(JAS) local file "/Users/john/Desktop/Interesting X3D files/ProximitySensorTests/test1" 
		shows some random visual errors; far clip plane, and LOD of torches not correct, and 
		OSX sound issues.

30/04/2009:
	(JAS) Russ Kinters ProximitySensor test revisit.
		 http://www.sevenemeraldtablets.net/FreeBeamToBox.wrl works if you change the script to 
			field SFVec3f newPos 0 0 0
			field SFRotation newRot 0 1 0 0
			...
			//vm.getTransform(BeamtoVP.position,BeamtoVP.orientation);
			vm.getTransform(newPos,newRot);
			BeamtoVP.position = newPos;
			BeamtoVP.orientation = newRot;
		How do we get the SetProperty to fire for the BeamtoVP nodes?

	(JAS) Verify examine distance in GeoViewpoint.

29/04/2009: 
	(JAS) Document libeai C calls, and ensure that web pages show how to use this feature.
	(JAS) environment variable "FREEWRL_STRICT_PARSING" - add an export for it for OSX freex3d; change linux front end to see if it is invoked as freewrl.

27/04/2009:
	(JAS) KML and Collada for Geospatial.
	(JAS) rotation_toy.wrl" collision with elements in HUD; moves shape slowly away. How can we stop collisions in HUD elements?
	(answer - we cant, do not bother trying, at least for now DONE)


30/03/2009:
	(JAS) Verify that IndexedFaceSet textureCoordinateIndexes are used properly - ashby.wrl image problems.

25/03/2009: 
	(JAS) Classic VRML parser uses new PROTO routing scheme (see code for details) move this over to XML
	parser.

22/03/2009:
	(JAS) the VRMLNodes table, last field in a Field Definition, gives problems and needs updating.
	1) all fields must be same type for VRML parser to consistently allow routes; eg "children" MUST be
	   "inputOutput" even if some nodes define "children" as "inputOnly".
 
05/03/2009: 
	(JAS) Texture loading; if a texture is "mid-processing" and the geometry moves off
	screen, it is possible that texture loading will hang. (Geospatial tiling can show this
	problem)

05/03/2009:
	(JAS) plugFest CreateX3dFromStringRandomSpheres.x3d - has Script with SFNode param:
	    <Script DEF='SphereGeneratorScript' directOutput='true'>
	      <field accessType='initializeOnly' name='ModifiableExternalNode' type='SFNode'>
	        <Group USE='HoldsAutogeneratedContent'/>
	      </field>
		which is not parsed correctly, because it breaks up the field list for the script.


04/03/2009:
	(JAS) Standalone OSX player - see if long filenames on standalone overflows buffer at main.m line 18.
	cd'ing further into a directory allows freewrl to run ok.

03/03/2009:
	(JAS) X3DParser, corrects incorrectly scoped Metadata (see, approx line 866 in X3DParser.c).
	FreeWRL parses this now, FreeX3D should throw an error.


26/02/2009:
	(DONE) (JAS) Work on verifying capabilities, src/lib/x3d_parser/capabilitiesHandler.c.

	(JAS) Continue filling in ECMAScript capabilities; see "NEWCLASSES" ifdef in the code.
		- latest non-released spec requested from Dick Puck, 26/02/09, as the on on-line
		  is from 2005.	


25/02/2009: OSX and possibly Linux:
	freewrl http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Basic/GeoSpatial/HelloEarth.x3d
	on command line prepends current path; eg: 
	problem reading file '/Users/john/http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/exa...

24/02/2009: on OSX, the following tests have problems:

	20 - not sorted?
	SFImage.wrl - box not changing texture

06/02/09: New build on some Linux distros fails. Decide what to do about this - currently thinking
	about supporting both makefile.pl and autotools, until the autotools one can be built once other Linuxes 
        catch up with Debian.

	Note - autotools version requires automake-1.10 right now (stable as of jan.2008)

-------
- design & implement a modern log,warning & error reporting (all)
  -> configurable at compilation time (enable/disable parts of debug information)
  -> configurable at runtime (...)

- review all Geospatial nodes (JohnS)
- implement FloatingOrigin in Geospatial code (Johns)
- Points and Lines - send upstream bounds, as per faceset nodes (JohnS)
- OSX - standalone front end - enable printing;
- OSX - standalone front end - ensure pulldown menu items tied with actual rendering variables
- OSX - stanaalone front end - "q" key does not store window parameters in OSX; can "q" be mapped to
  call normal cocoa exit routine?
- OSX - standalone front end - sometimes, especially with textured world, front/back buffers are not
  updated; it is as if one of them gets forgotten about (verify which one with opengl profiler). Complex
  worlds with lots of textures seem to trigger it.


- EAI - Sarah (C bindings) and JohnS (Russ Kinters testing, and general Java code)
- threading issues with XLib - harold and Michel.
- merge into freewrl
- OSX standalone front end updateContext()
- XML parser - Script and Proto work, and general cleanup
- DVD standalone - get Geospatial content on there, and running.
- Shader variables not parsed nor sent to shaders.
- OSX sound revisit.
- GlassBunny.wrl - CubeMap textures (Michel) and Shader variables (Johns).
- resolve QA issues in the code - implicit function declarations, etc. (Ian,Michel?)
- debug browser plugin

Wishlist:

- QTVR images from OSX 
- deliver x11freewrl on OSX, in addition to cocoa version
- create freewrl links on Linux and OSX
- update the plugin to provide EAI/SAI access via browser's javascript

Priority list (as of 20/11/2008):

- EAI - Sarah and Russ Kinter
- merge into freewrl
- Apple - Gurob email
- OSX standalone front end updateContext()
- XML parser - Script and Proto work, and general cleanup
- Shader variables
- Component verification
