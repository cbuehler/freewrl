Priority list (as of 04/02/2009)

- review all Geospatial nodes (JohnS)
- implement FloatingOrigin in Geospatial code (Johns)
- Points and Lines - send upstream bounds, as per faceset nodes (JohnS)
- Review all uses of gluUnproject in code (Johns)
- OSX - standalone front end - enable printing;
- OSX - standalone front end - ensure pulldown menu items tied with actual rendering variables
- OSX - stanaalone front end - "q" key does not store window parameters in OSX; can "q" be mapped to
  call normal cocoa exit routine?
- OSX - standalone front end - sometimes, especially with textured world, front/back buffers are not
  updated; it is as if one of them gets forgotten about (verify which one with opengl profiler). Complex
  worlds with lots of textures seem to trigger it.


- EAI - Sarah (C bindings) and JohnS (Russ Kinters testing, and general Java code)
- threading issues with XLib - harold and Michel.
- merge into freex3d
- OSX standalone front end updateContext()
- View Frustum - see PalaceWalkthrough and Geospatial code. (in progress -JohnS)
- XML parser - Script and Proto work, and general cleanup
- DVD standalone - get Geospatial content on there, and running.
- FillProperties - use brickshader style shader to implement them.
- Shader variables not parsed nor sent to shaders.
- OSX sound revisit.
- GlassBunny.wrl - CubeMap textures (Michel) and Shader variables (Johns).


Wishlist:

- QTVR images from OSX 
- deliver x11freewrl on OSX, in addition to cocoa version
- create freex3d links on Linux and OSX
