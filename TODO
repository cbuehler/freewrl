Priority list (as of 06/02/2009)

06/02/09: Examine orientations incorrect.
	take tests/1.wrl, add:
	Viewpoint {description "1" position 0 0 10}
	Viewpoint {description "2" orientation 0 1 0 3.14 position 0 0 -10}
	Viewpoint {description "3" orientation 0 1 0 1.57 position 10 0 0}
	Viewpoint {description "4" orientation 0 -1 0 1.57 position -10 0 0}
	and note that vps 3 and 4 rotate incorrectly; and that farPlane calculated incorrectly for 2.

06/02/09: New build on some Linux distros fails. Decide what to do about this - currently thinking
	about supporting both, until the "new" style one can be built once other Linuxes catch up
	with Debian.

-------
- design & implement a modern log,warning & error reporting (all)
  -> configurable at compilation time (enable/disable parts of debug information)
  -> configurable at runtime (...)

- review all Geospatial nodes (JohnS)
- implement FloatingOrigin in Geospatial code (Johns)
- Points and Lines - send upstream bounds, as per faceset nodes (JohnS)
- Review all uses of gluUnproject in code (Johns)
- OSX - standalone front end - enable printing;
- OSX - standalone front end - ensure pulldown menu items tied with actual rendering variables
- OSX - stanaalone front end - "q" key does not store window parameters in OSX; can "q" be mapped to
  call normal cocoa exit routine?
- OSX - standalone front end - sometimes, especially with textured world, front/back buffers are not
  updated; it is as if one of them gets forgotten about (verify which one with opengl profiler). Complex
  worlds with lots of textures seem to trigger it.


- EAI - Sarah (C bindings) and JohnS (Russ Kinters testing, and general Java code)
- threading issues with XLib - harold and Michel.
- merge into freex3d
- OSX standalone front end updateContext()
- View Frustum - see PalaceWalkthrough and Geospatial code. (in progress -JohnS)
- XML parser - Script and Proto work, and general cleanup
- DVD standalone - get Geospatial content on there, and running.
- FillProperties - use brickshader style shader to implement them.
- Shader variables not parsed nor sent to shaders.
- OSX sound revisit.
- GlassBunny.wrl - CubeMap textures (Michel) and Shader variables (Johns).


Wishlist:

- QTVR images from OSX 
- deliver x11freewrl on OSX, in addition to cocoa version
- create freex3d links on Linux and OSX
