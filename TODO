	(JAS) via Marvin Simkin:
		Your movement speed in fly mode does not seem to be sensitive to the following:
		NavigationInfo { speed 123.45 }
		so if I have a big model with a large speed value, the movement crawls so slow 
		as to be unusable.
11/06/2009: 
	(JAS) Review all nodes so that they send events when compiled or made.

09/23/2009:
	From Russ Kinter; http://www.sevenemeraldtablets.net/VisibilityTest/VisibilityTest2.wrl 
	a) VisibilitySensor gets removed by LOD thus never gets drawn to indicate it is out of the scene;
	b) Russ says clicking on Cones cause incorrect Viewpoint movement.

09/21/2009:
        Another IndexedFaceSet bug to put on the list: (from Simon dot Place at googlemail)
        Shape {
                geometry IndexedFaceSet {
                convex FALSE
                        coord Coordinate {
                                point [ 2 0 0, 0 2 0, -2 0 0,0 -2 0, 1 0 0,0 -1 0,-1 0 0,0 1 0 ]
                        }
                        coordIndex [ 0 1 2 3 0 4 5 6 7 4 ]
                }
        }
        should be a diamond within a diamond.


08/07/2009:
        (MB)  Imlib2 can load & decode: gif, jpg, png, tiff, ...
              Implementation is in LoadTextures.c. I'm trying to understand
              how to modify loading during rendering...
	(JAS) look at using OpenAL
        (MB)  Specific DEBUG defines for specific parts : all in src/lib/debug.h. 


08/02/2009:
	(JAS) shader differences between OSX and Linux; eg:
	http://freewrl.sf.net/tomasMikulaExample.x3dv

08/02/2009:
	(JAS) MIDI/C EAI input appears to loose events once in a while. Verify
	by making townSquare.wrl have wallDelay be set just before clock 
	tower ding.

07/15/2009: 
	(JAS) tests/8.wrl - on IanS computer, comes up with: 
		SFNativeNew - created 0 nodes, expected 1 only
		JS_GetPrivate failed in SFNodeFinalize.
	but other SFNode javascript tests pass.
	- note seems to be threading bug; if "isBusy=busy" fails fairly regularly; if "isBusy = val; " runs regularly.


06/30/2009:
	(JAS) Wondering about collision and small scales; Bob Kilmek's second example should not have collisions.

(going through specs, finding what component conformance level FreeWRL is currently at; lower priority) 06/16/2009:
	TimeSensor pause - verify code.
	ImageTexture - textureProperties field.
	MovieTexture - textureProperties field.
	TextureProperties Node.
	EaseInEaseOut Node.
	SplinePositionInterpolator Node
	SplinePositionInterpolator2D Node
	SplineScalarInterpolator Node
	SquadOrientationInterpolator Node

	Think about:
		VRML1_AsciiText
		VRML1_FontStyle
		VRML1_MatrixTransform
		VRML1_Switch
		VRML1_WWWAnchor
		VRML1_LOD
		VRML1_OrthographicCamera
		VRML1_PerspectiveCamera
		VRML1_WWWInline
	Spec is at: http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/VRML1.0


05/06/2009:
	(JAS) Continue going through current X3D spec to ensure that all fields of all nodes are parsed correctly.
	Continue at chapter 11, Rendering component. - check ElevationGrid and GeoElevationGrid, then continue on.

27/05/2009:
	(JAS) Geospatial viewpoint examine mode distance - need to revisit calculations. Note that
	going examineMode->nextVP->walkMode->examineMode recalculates distance ok...
	is the examine->Origin set correctly? Do we need to set it? What is the origin supposed to be?
	Code has been changed (June 2 2009) that does "ok" but we need more work to sort this out.
	(July 14 2009, more work on Geospatial; this is an ongoing subject, I guess...)

26/05/2009: 
	(JAS) XML PROTO routing scheme 
		- verify routes to/from PROTOS;
		- verify that EAI can get info from PROTOS.

20/05/2009: 
	(JAS) still some old proto stuff in classic parser; look at parser_interfaceDeclaration and purge.

18/05/2009:
	(JAS) From Mufti;
		- freewrl file:///tmp/PureVrmlExport.wrl fails;
		- Freewrl do not compile without some "XF86/XF86VidModeModeInfo" things 
  		  (again). Please add a matching test case in your machine park...

13/05/2009: 
	(JAS) Javascript.
		- added sfvec4f and sfvec4d input/output; only basic methods defined. There is nothing in the
		  X3D scripting pages about 4f and 4d types.

01/05/2009:
	(JAS) OSX Sound node - in middle of updating code. Complete, and migrate to XCode.
	(JAS) it is possible to loose objects at farClipPlane when "backing up" 
	(JAS) local file "/Users/john/Desktop/Interesting X3D files/ProximitySensorTests/test1" 
		shows some random visual errors; far clip plane, and LOD of torches not correct, and 
		OSX sound issues.

30/04/2009:
	(JAS) Russ Kinters ProximitySensor test revisit.
		 http://www.sevenemeraldtablets.net/FreeBeamToBox.wrl works if you change the script to 
			field SFVec3f newPos 0 0 0
			field SFRotation newRot 0 1 0 0
			...
			//vm.getTransform(BeamtoVP.position,BeamtoVP.orientation);
			vm.getTransform(newPos,newRot);
			BeamtoVP.position = newPos;
			BeamtoVP.orientation = newRot;
		How do we get the SetProperty to fire for the BeamtoVP nodes?

29/04/2009: 
	(JAS) Document libeai C calls, and ensure that web pages show how to use this feature.
	(JAS) environment variable "FREEWRL_STRICT_PARSING" - add an export for it for OSX freex3d; change linux front end to see if it is invoked as freewrl.

27/04/2009:
	(JAS) KML and Collada for Geospatial.
	(JAS) rotation_toy.wrl" collision with elements in HUD; moves shape slowly away. How can we stop collisions in HUD elements?
	(answer - we cant, do not bother trying, at least for now DONE)


30/03/2009:
	(JAS) Verify that IndexedFaceSet textureCoordinateIndexes are used properly - ashby.wrl image problems.

22/03/2009:
	(JAS) the VRMLNodes table, last field in a Field Definition, gives problems and needs updating.
	1) all fields must be same type for VRML parser to consistently allow routes; eg "children" MUST be
	   "inputOutput" even if some nodes define "children" as "inputOnly".
 
05/03/2009: 
	(JAS) Texture loading; if a texture is "mid-processing" and the geometry moves off
	screen, it is possible that texture loading will hang. (Geospatial tiling can show this
	problem)

05/03/2009:
	(JAS) plugFest CreateX3dFromStringRandomSpheres.x3d - has Script with SFNode param:
	    <Script DEF='SphereGeneratorScript' directOutput='true'>
	      <field accessType='initializeOnly' name='ModifiableExternalNode' type='SFNode'>
	        <Group USE='HoldsAutogeneratedContent'/>
	      </field>
		which is not parsed correctly, because it breaks up the field list for the script.


04/03/2009:
	(JAS) Standalone OSX player - see if long filenames on standalone overflows buffer at main.m line 18.
	cd'ing further into a directory allows freewrl to run ok.

03/03/2009:
	(JAS) X3DParser, corrects incorrectly scoped Metadata (see, approx line 866 in X3DParser.c).
	FreeWRL parses this now, FreeX3D should throw an error.


26/02/2009:
	(JAS) Continue filling in ECMAScript capabilities; see "NEWCLASSES" ifdef in the code.
		- latest non-released spec requested from Dick Puck, 26/02/09, as the on on-line
		  is from 2005.	


25/02/2009: OSX and possibly Linux:
	freewrl http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Basic/GeoSpatial/HelloEarth.x3d
	on command line prepends current path; eg: 
	problem reading file '/Users/john/http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/exa...

24/02/2009: on OSX, the following tests have problems:

	20 - not sorted?
	SFImage.wrl - box not changing texture

06/02/09: New build on some Linux distros fails. Decide what to do about this - currently thinking
	about supporting both makefile.pl and autotools, until the autotools one can be built once other Linuxes 
        catch up with Debian.

	Note - autotools version requires automake-1.10 right now (stable as of jan.2008)

-------
- design & implement a modern log,warning & error reporting (all)
  -> configurable at compilation time (enable/disable parts of debug information)
  -> configurable at runtime (...)

- implement FloatingOrigin in Geospatial code (Johns)
- Points and Lines - send upstream bounds, as per faceset nodes (JohnS)
- OSX - standalone front end - enable printing;
- OSX - standalone front end - ensure pulldown menu items tied with actual rendering variables
- OSX - stanaalone front end - "q" key does not store window parameters in OSX; can "q" be mapped to
  call normal cocoa exit routine?
- OSX - standalone front end - sometimes, especially with textured world, front/back buffers are not
  updated; it is as if one of them gets forgotten about (verify which one with opengl profiler). Complex
  worlds with lots of textures seem to trigger it.


- EAI - Sarah (C bindings) and JohnS (Russ Kinters testing, and general Java code)
- threading issues with XLib - harold and Michel.
- merge into freewrl
- OSX standalone front end updateContext()
- XML parser - Script and Proto work, and general cleanup
- DVD standalone - get Geospatial content on there, and running.
- OSX sound revisit.
- resolve QA issues in the code - implicit function declarations, etc. (Ian,Michel?)
- debug browser plugin

Wishlist:

- QTVR images from OSX 
- deliver x11freewrl on OSX, in addition to cocoa version
- create freewrl links on Linux and OSX
- update the plugin to provide EAI/SAI access via browser's javascript

Priority list (as of 20/11/2008):

- EAI - Sarah and Russ Kinter
- merge into freewrl
- Apple - Gurob email
- OSX standalone front end updateContext()
- XML parser - Script and Proto work, and general cleanup
- Component verification
