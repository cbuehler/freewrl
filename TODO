Priority list (as of 28/02/2009)
25/03/2009: 
	(JAS) Classic VRML parser uses new PROTO routing scheme (see code for details) move this over to XML
	parser.

22/03/2009:
	(JAS) the VRMLNodes table, last field in a Field Definition, gives problems and needs updating.
	1) all fields must be same type for VRML parser to consistently allow routes; eg "children" MUST be
	   "inputOutput" even if some nodes define "children" as "inputOnly".
	2) have to encode specification level in fields; eg "switch" has fields differing on X3D and VRML.
	   Maybe also can encode component level in fields.
 
05/03/2009: 
	(JAS) Texture loading; if a texture is "mid-processing" and the geometry moves off
	screen, it is possible that texture loading will hang. (Geospatial tiling can show this
	problem)

05/03/2009:
	(JAS) plugFest CreateX3dFromStringRandomSpheres.x3d - has Script with SFNode param:
	    <Script DEF='SphereGeneratorScript' directOutput='true'>
	      <field accessType='initializeOnly' name='ModifiableExternalNode' type='SFNode'>
	        <Group USE='HoldsAutogeneratedContent'/>
	      </field>
		which is not parsed correctly, because it breaks up the field list for the script.


04/03/2009:
	(JAS) Standalone OSX player - see if long filenames on standalone overflows buffer at main.m line 18.
	cd'ing further into a directory allows freewrl to run ok.

03/03/2009:
	(JAS) X3DParser, corrects incorrectly scoped Metadata (see, approx line 866 in X3DParser.c).
	FreeWRL parses this now, FreeX3D should throw an error.


28/02/2009:
	(JAS) ConsoleMessage - when copying rest of text in classic parser for error location,
	make copied string length max 200 chars.

	(JAS) Verify that x3d, x3dv, and wrl files set _isX3D and _isXML correctly.
	Some of the Conformance tests now fail.


26/02/2009:
	(JAS) Work on verifying capabilities, src/lib/x3d_parser/capabilitiesHandler.c.

	(JAS) Continue filling in ECMAScript capabilities; see "NEWCLASSES" ifdef in the code.
		- latest non-released spec requested from Dick Puck, 26/02/09, as the on on-line
		  is from 2005.	
	(JAS) Continue working on the VrmlMatrix commands - verify every method.


25/02/2009: OSX and possibly Linux:
	freewrl http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Basic/GeoSpatial/HelloEarth.x3d
	on command line prepends current path; eg: 
	problem reading file '/Users/john/http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/exa...

24/02/2009: on OSX, the following tests have problems:

	19 - pink robot? *			(FIXED- do_shininess call JAS)
	20 - not sorted?
	25,26 - Textures on backgrounds. 	(FIXED - texture box vertices changed JAS)
	47.wrl (beachball) fwLoad, unknown -111	(FIXED - was opengl optimization call - removed JAS)
	49.wrl - no output?
	50 - FreeWRL: SoundEngine not installed on system
	9.wrl - shapes disappear.
	SFImage.wrl - box not changing texture
	pp2.x3d - nothing shown.
	stringSensor.x3dv - hangs? 		(FIXED - initialized was set to TRUE at start JAS)


06/02/09: Examine orientations incorrect.
	take tests/1.wrl, add:
	Viewpoint {description "1" position 0 0 10}
	Viewpoint {description "2" orientation 0 1 0 3.14 position 0 0 -10}
	Viewpoint {description "3" orientation 0 1 0 1.57 position 10 0 0}
	Viewpoint {description "4" orientation 0 -1 0 1.57 position -10 0 0}
	and note that vps 3 and 4 rotate incorrectly; and that farPlane calculated incorrectly for 2.

06/02/09: New build on some Linux distros fails. Decide what to do about this - currently thinking
	about supporting both makefile.pl and autotools, until the autotools one can be built once other Linuxes 
        catch up with Debian.

	Note - autotools version requires automake-1.10 right now (stable as of jan.2008)

-------
- design & implement a modern log,warning & error reporting (all)
  -> configurable at compilation time (enable/disable parts of debug information)
  -> configurable at runtime (...)

- review all Geospatial nodes (JohnS)
- implement FloatingOrigin in Geospatial code (Johns)
- Points and Lines - send upstream bounds, as per faceset nodes (JohnS)
- Review all uses of gluUnproject in code (Johns)
- OSX - standalone front end - enable printing;
- OSX - standalone front end - ensure pulldown menu items tied with actual rendering variables
- OSX - stanaalone front end - "q" key does not store window parameters in OSX; can "q" be mapped to
  call normal cocoa exit routine?
- OSX - standalone front end - sometimes, especially with textured world, front/back buffers are not
  updated; it is as if one of them gets forgotten about (verify which one with opengl profiler). Complex
  worlds with lots of textures seem to trigger it.


- EAI - Sarah (C bindings) and JohnS (Russ Kinters testing, and general Java code)
- threading issues with XLib - harold and Michel.
- merge into freewrl
- OSX standalone front end updateContext()
- View Frustum - see PalaceWalkthrough and Geospatial code. (in progress -JohnS)
- XML parser - Script and Proto work, and general cleanup
- DVD standalone - get Geospatial content on there, and running.
- FillProperties - use brickshader style shader to implement them.
- Shader variables not parsed nor sent to shaders.
- OSX sound revisit.
- GlassBunny.wrl - CubeMap textures (Michel) and Shader variables (Johns).
- resolve QA issues in the code - implicit function declarations, etc. (Ian,Michel?)
- debug browser plugin

Wishlist:

- QTVR images from OSX 
- deliver x11freewrl on OSX, in addition to cocoa version
- create freewrl links on Linux and OSX
- update the plugin to provide EAI/SAI access via browser's javascript

Priority list (as of 20/11/2008):

- EAI - Sarah and Russ Kinter
- merge into freewrl
- Apple - Gurob email
- OSX standalone front end updateContext()
- XML parser - Script and Proto work, and general cleanup
- FillProperties
- Shader variables
- Component verification
